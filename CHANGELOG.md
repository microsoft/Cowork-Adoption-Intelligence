# Changelog

## 7.0.0-testing - 2026-10-07

- Redesigned Adoption Maturity around direct, filter-aware evidence instead of
  an abstract weighted delegation index.
- Replaced the ambiguous Automating task list with the user-group selector
  `Delegating | Uses scheduling`; task bars are explicitly titled
  `Task count by selected users` and do not claim that individual tasks were
  scheduled or automated.
- Added visible task-count labels and validated both user-group states.
- Stabilized user-group membership across task bars so each task row cannot
  reclassify users; synthetic validation reconciles 212 Delegating and 688 Uses
  scheduling tasks to the full 900-task population.
- Renamed maturity KPIs with plain-language numerators and denominators:
  delegating / scheduling, tasks using 2+ skills, active users
  in the latest week, average steps per task, scheduled tasks / all tasks, and
  after-hours tasks / all tasks.
- Aligned Adoption Maturity screen-reader descriptions with the weekly stage
  chart and direct delegating-or-scheduling population share.
- Synchronized the Adoption Maturity bookmark with the chart's weekly date
  grain so the saved state cannot restore the retired monthly projection.
- Completed the eight-page Fit to page review against deterministic fabricated
  data and published only that synthetic render set. DRPP, source-template,
  tenant, and customer-data screenshots remain excluded.
- Audited the deterministic synthetic baseline: 876 of 900 tasks are business
  classified, 24 are orchestration-only, and no tasks are unclassified.
- Removed customer-specific parameter defaults so both required inputs open as
  blank prompts, with direct SharePoint HTTPS-path and authentication guidance.
- Synchronized the editable V7 PBIP source with the packaged report and live
  semantic model.
- Validated 8 pages, 296 visuals, 29 bookmarks, 50 model tables, 362 measures,
  and 32 relationships with zero PBIR or TMDL errors.
- Exported `Cowork Adoption Intelligence V7.pbit` without imported customer
  data, local QA paths, or customer identifiers; retained the tenant Public
  label and Desktop-generated `SecurityBindings`.
- Archived the prior direct-PAX V6 template for rollback.

## 6.0.0-testing - 2026-10-02

- Replaced the V5 preprocessed-entity ingestion path with two direct PAX
  parameters: `Cowork Adoption Purview File` and
  `Cowork Adoption Users File`.
- Reduced the report to eight focused pages: Cowork Adoption Scorecard, Weekly
  Adoption & Usage, Scalable Work Patterns, Demand & Capacity Scenario,
  Adoption Maturity, Category Users, Capacity Assumptions, and Adoption Metric
  Guide.
- Added Work Timing analysis, after-hours task measures, friendly Primary Tool
  attribution, category-task hierarchy detail, and synchronized category-minute
  assumptions.
- Rebuilt Demand & Capacity Scenario with independent observed-task and modeled
  assisted-hours shares, visible percentage labels, department/task heatmaps,
  and Primary Tool/Copilot Model filters.
- Clarified that modeled assisted hours and labor value are scenarios, not
  realized savings or available workforce capacity.
- Validated all eight rendered pages, 296 visuals, 29 bookmarks, 49 model
  tables, 353 measures, and 32 relationships.
- Reconciled the QA baseline at 97 observed tasks, 16 task users, 52.0167
  modeled assisted hours, 34 after-hours tasks, and two normalized category
  shares totaling 100% each.
- Exported `Cowork Adoption Intelligence V6.pbit` with both required parameters
  blank, no imported customer data or local QA paths, the Public/Not Restricted
  label (`ContentBits=0`), and a Desktop-generated `SecurityBindings` stream.
- Archived the previous root preprocessed template for existing deployments and
  marked the automation/sample packages as legacy V5 resources.

## 5.0.0-testing - 2026-09-29

- Replaced the ten-page V4.1 report with the validated nine-page recommended
  layout: Cowork Adoption Scorecard, Weekly Adoption & Usage, Adoption by
  Attributes, Scalable Work Patterns, Demand & Capacity Scenario, Adoption
  Maturity, Enablement Partners, Capacity Assumptions, and Adoption Metric Guide.
- Integrated Start Here guidance into Cowork Adoption Scorecard instead of
  shipping a separate navigation page.
- Synchronized the editable PBIP source with the 284-visual, 27-bookmark report
  validated in Power BI Desktop.
- Consolidated the repeated heatmap guidance into one short line and enlarged the
  heatmap evidence matrix.
- Rebuilt the nine-page README carousel from clean report-only captures without
  Power BI Desktop recovery, refresh, or update banners.
- Published the customer template as `Cowork Adoption V3.pbit`, applied the
  Public sensitivity label, reopened the exported file, and confirmed that the
  label persisted.
- Added the complete automation package for Power Automate, Azure Container Apps
  Jobs, PAX v1.11.15, the validated Cowork Python processor, compatibility
  validation, Azure deployment, and least-privilege job-start access.
- Added the exact cloud-flow build guide and machine-readable orchestration map;
  the map is documentation and is not an importable Power Automate solution ZIP.
- Made the validated preprocessed entity path the only current ingestion route
  and retained prior V4.0 templates only as archived rollback artifacts.
- Replaced the obsolete ten-page screenshots, video, storyboard, SharePoint
  builder, and standalone preprocessor bundle with the nine-page release assets
  and combined automation bundle.
- Updated setup, interpretation, security, and release evidence for the
  recommended layout, customer-controlled capacity assumptions, and the
  verified label-related `SecurityBindings` stream.

## 4.1.0-testing - 2026-09-25

- Added the standard-library
  `scripts/Cowork_Purview_Preprocessor_v0.1.0.py` workflow and its versioned
  `cowork-contract.json`.
- Added deterministic generation and independent validation of 13 entity CSVs
  plus `manifest.json`.
- Replaced the primary root PBIT and editable PBIP source with the validated
  preprocessed-ingestion release.
- Reduced customer template setup to one required parameter:
  `PreprocessedOutputPath`.
- Corrected optimized row-level Champion ranking and confirmed
  `2 summary / 2 row-level / 0 delta`.
- Passed offline TOM/TMDL import with 45 tables, 321 measures, 408 columns, 45
  partitions, and 27 active relationships.
- Passed PBIR validation with zero errors and zero warnings.
- Opened the exported PBIT in a clean Power BI Desktop process, confirmed one
  parameter prompt, loaded all 45 partitions, and reconciled core totals and
  both Champion identities and scores.
- Preprocessed the 70,976-row fixture in 14.811 seconds and the
  1,050,000-row synthetic fixture in 200.528 seconds. Large-scale timings are
  evidence, not a service-level objective.
- Backed up the previous raw-Purview and SharePoint V4.0 PBITs under
  `release/archive/` for rollback.

## 4.0.0-testing - 2026-09-23

- Replaced the local-folder distributable with the supplied **Cowork Adoption
  Intelligence V4** template.
- Rebuilt the SharePoint-compatible V4 template from the same model.
- Renamed the interpretation storyboard for the V4 release and standardized all
  three release filenames on the correctly spelled **Intelligence**.
- Updated the SharePoint conversion workflow for V4's consolidated
  `Staging_ModelData` ingestion query.
- Removed machine-bound `SecurityBindings` from both public PBIT packages and
  refreshed their release verification metadata.

## 3.0.0-testing - 2026-09-17

- Renamed the distributable template to **Cowork Adoption Intelligence V3**.
- Redesigned Momentum Settings as the plain-language **Momentum Score Guide**
  with a live score, component explanations, guardrails, and optional advanced
  controls.
- Added a separate SharePoint-compatible V3 template with two URL parameters,
  one static `SharePoint.Files` connector, recursive folder filtering, and
  binary-based CSV discovery.
- Synchronized the editable PBIR source with the validated V3 package.
- Restored the delegation-maturity component of champion scoring and verified
  sample evidence scores up to 100.0 with Top 5%, 10%, and 20% counts of 4, 8,
  and 15.
- Corrected month-to-date run-rate forecasting, per-month activity measures, and
  the rolling-history date table.
- Disclosed the lifetime grain of scheduled-task totals and made Audit Coverage
  unavailable under narrowed date filters.
- Standardized the delegation ladder on Not started, Trying, Using, Delegating,
  and Automating with one documented threshold set.
- Updated all ten Metric Guide sections and documented adjustable momentum
  weights, the 100% weight guard, and cross-tenant noncomparability.
- Clarified rate assumptions, replaced misleading list-price terminology,
  corrected allocation iterators, and documented retained compatibility aliases.
- Re-exported the data-free PBIT with the Public sensitivity label and no
  machine-bound `SecurityBindings`.

## 2.0.1-testing - 2026-09-14

- Added a transparent 0-100 evidence score using category activity (40%),
  active-week consistency (35%), and delegation maturity (25%).
- Added Top 5%, Top 10%, and Top 20% tiers with a three-task and two-week
  eligibility floor and deterministic tie-breaking.
- Added ranked candidates, enablement guidance, interpretation boundaries, and
  definitions in the Adoption Metric Guide.
- Preserved the single `DataFolderPath` prompt and removed imported data and
  Desktop-only security bindings from the distributable PBIT.
